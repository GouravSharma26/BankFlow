# BankFlow — Phase Log and Review Record

> Append-only project history. Record verified outcomes, not intentions. Do not mark work completed until the acceptance evidence is available.

## Current Status

- Overall status: `PHASE 0 VERIFIED / IMPLEMENTATION NOT STARTED`
- Current phase: `Phase 0 — Repository Baseline and Agent Alignment` (Completed)
- Last verified implementation phase: `None (Phase 0 baseline verified; implementation begins in Phase 1)`
- GitHub repository: <https://github.com/GouravSharma26/BankFlow>
- Baseline commit: `b863ee1`
- Last reviewed commit: `b863ee1`

## How to Maintain This File

For every phase, add a new entry below the template. Keep earlier entries as historical evidence; correct factual errors with a dated note rather than quietly rewriting the history. Record the exact commit SHA, branch, push status, commands, test counts, and reviewer findings.

## Phase Entries

### Planning Documentation Prepared

- Status: `DOCUMENTATION PREPARED — IMPLEMENTATION NOT STARTED`
- Date: `2026-10-16`
- Scope: Master plan and agent/developer workflow documentation prepared for review and placement in the repository.
- Implementation verification: `Not applicable; no application code is claimed by this entry.`
- GitHub push: `Not verified; this local documentation package has not been confirmed on GitHub.`
- Next action: Verify the local folder and remote, commit/push the documentation baseline, then execute Phase 0/Phase 1 according to `DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md`.

### Phase 0 — Repository Baseline and Agent Alignment

- Status: VERIFIED
- Date: 2026-10-16
- Branch: main
- Commit SHA: b863ee1 (Baseline push)
- GitHub URL: <https://github.com/GouravSharma26/BankFlow/commit/b863ee1>
- Push status: Pushed successfully to `origin/main`
- Objective: Verify repository structure, documents, Git configuration, establish the clean documentation baseline on GitHub, and align with agent operating guidelines before starting application code.
- Changes delivered:
  - Validated all 15 required planning, documentation, and agent workflow files.
  - Preserved `plan.md` as canonical specification without regression.
  - Initialized Git repository with default branch `main`.
  - Configured remote `origin` to `https://github.com/GouravSharma26/BankFlow.git`.
  - Verified Git identity (`GouravSharma26` / `gourav123sharma4567@gmail.com`).
  - Verified local environment tool versions (Git 2.46.0, Python 3.12.6, pip 25.0.1, PostgreSQL 17.4).
  - Pushed initial documentation baseline commit `b863ee1` to GitHub `main`.
- Tests/commands executed:
  - `git ls-remote https://github.com/GouravSharma26/BankFlow.git` (verified empty remote ready for push)
  - `git init -b main`
  - `git remote add origin https://github.com/GouravSharma26/BankFlow.git`
  - `git config user.name; git config user.email`
  - `git --version; python --version; python -m pip --version; psql --version`
  - `git add AGENTS.md ANTIGRAVITY_START_HERE.md DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md HUMAN_SETUP.md PHASE_LOG.md README.md REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md plan.md docs/`
  - `git commit -m "docs(baseline): establish project specification and agent workflow"`
  - `git push -u origin main`
- Test outcomes: All pre-flight checks and Git commands succeeded with exit code 0.
- Acceptance evidence: Baseline commit `b863ee1` is pushed and visible on GitHub `main` at `https://github.com/GouravSharma26/BankFlow/tree/main`.
- Review findings: None (baseline phase).
- Fixes or accepted risks: None.
- Known limitations: Application implementation has not started yet (Phase 1 will begin the application skeleton and synthetic generator).
- Next action: Handoff Phase 0 for review; next phase is Phase 1 — Python Foundation, Synthetic Generator, and Staging.
